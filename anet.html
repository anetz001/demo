      <h1>IMPORTANCE OF AI IN LEARNING</h1>
      <p>AI has the potential to revolutionize the education sector by enhancing learning experiences, supporting teachers and offering more personalized learning opportunities for students. We must equip teachers with the knowledge and strategies they will need to use this new technology to improve and streamline everyday processes as well as classroom implementation.
Some areas in which AI can transform the classroom include personalized learning, ideation, adaptive learning, special needs education, bilingual education, gamification and immersive learning.</p>

      <h1>IN HTML: A BEGINNERS GUIDE</h1> IN HTML: A BEGINNERS GUIDE
    <P>HTML is an acronym for “HyperText Markup Language.” Allow me to break this down:

      First, “HyperText” is text on a web page that references another web page. You probably know these as hyperlinks, such as this one. Hyperlinks typically bring us to a different web page or a different section of the same page. Hyperlinks can also open a PDF, email, or multimedia, like a video or audio file.
      Linking information together via hypertext was revolutionary in building the web we know today. When you’re “browsing the web,” you’re just clicking hyperlinks that take you to different web pages. Even if those pages are more complex and dynamic, like on a social media site or web application, at their core, these are all just HTML documents that display information.</P>
